Pre-requisites:

Basic linear algebra: linear systems, Gauss elimination algorithm, matrices.

Basic analysis: boundedness of numerical functions, understanding
statement of an optimization problem.

Learning outcomes:

Ability to understand and implement simplex algorithm and its variants
to solve linear programs. The latter are optimization problems subject
to linear constraints.

Course Overview:

We give a detailed overview of the simplex algorithm and its variants,
one of the major algorithms solving linear optimization problems,
i.e. linear programs. After properly defining such programs we
establish a number of conditions under which they have finite
solutions. The simplex algorithm is firstly introduced under such
restrictive conditions before being extended to any general linear
program. Termination and validity of the algorithm are proven along
the course. An implementation of studied pseudo-code is given and
variants of the algorithms are discussed. Examples of low dimensional
linear programs are studied during tutoring sessions.


List of topics:

- Defining standard and slack forms of linear programs
- Geometric solutions to low dimensional linear programs
- Simplex algorithm in case of basic feasiblity
- Initialization - Ensuring feasiblity
- Duality - Proving validity


Assessement scheme:

Written exam at the end of the course.

Recommended courses:

A good read is Chapter VII 29 "Linear Programming" of "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.
